%% rodrigues_rot - Rotates array of 3D vectors by an angle theta about vector k.
%% Direction is determined by the right-hand (screw) rule.
%
% Syntax:  v_rot = rodrigues(v,k,theta)
%
% Inputs:
%    v - Array of three dimensional vectors to rotate. Array can be 
%           composed of N rows of 3D row vectors or N columns of 3D column
%           vectors. If v is 3x3 array, it is assumed that it is 3 rows of
%           3 3D row vectors.
%    k - Rotation axis (does not need to be unit vector)
%    theta - Rotation angle in radians; positive according to right-hand
%           (screw) rule
%
%   Note: k and individual 3D vectors in v array must be same orientation.
%           
%
% Outputs:
%    v_rot - Array of rotated vectors.
%
% Other m-files required: dot.m (built-in MATLAB)
% Subfunctions: none
% MAT-files required: none
